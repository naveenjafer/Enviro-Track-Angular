# Enviro-Track-Angular
A Sample page for examining one single track retirieved from EnviroCar API.

Continuing on the Work done in the EnviroSample repo, this implementation is in Angular JS. The OpenCPU integration has not been done yet to the 
angular page. 

# Running
Clone the Repo and run any local server and access index2.html.

# Know Issues
1) A refresh of the page is sometimes required to render the right maps. 
2) On slower internet connections there is a couple of seconds of delay before the map zooms to the actual location(till then the word map is shown)

# Future RoadMap
1) To integrate the developed R app.
2) To add better styles and define better layouts.
